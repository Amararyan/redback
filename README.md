The full blown GRB pipeline with Bilby

`How to Install:`
for the time being its recommended that you install with a symlink
this can be done using:
 `pip install -e .`
 This may not work on a cluster so installing locally is advised:
 pip install . --user
 
 This software relies on bilby and associated samplers.
