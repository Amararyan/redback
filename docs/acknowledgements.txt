If you use redback in a scientific publication please cite the eventual redback paper.
If you use redback to fit a model please cite redback and bilby papers.
Alongside this, we request that you also cite the paper for a specific sampler and model.
For all models the code model.citation will print the recommended citation to use if one utilises the model.
In some cases, this recommends redback itself. In which case, no extra citation is required.
