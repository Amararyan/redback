Basics of Bayesian inference and parameter estimation
============

To use redback we assume some level of familiarity with Bayesian inference and model fitting.
However, if this is not the case, :code:`bilby` provides a basic demonstration of Bayesian inference and
how it is implemented in :code:`bilby` for a basic problem of fitting a line is available in the :code:`bilby` `documentation <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/basics-of-parameter-estimation.html>`_

Redback workflow
-------------------------

In redback, we make this process homogenous specifically for fitting electromagnetic transients. The redback workflow for fitting is:

- Download the data from a public catalog, or provide your own data. Or simulate it.
- Load the data into a homogenous transient object, which does the necessary processing and provides simple way to plot data.
- The user then specifies a model (either already implemented in redback or their own function).
- Write a prior or use the default priors.
- Specify sampler settings as in :code:`bilby`
- Fit model!
- The fit returns a homogenous result object, which can be used for further diagnostics, and provides a simple way to plot the fit.

More advanced functionality
-------------------------

- The likelihood is by default set by the type of transient/data used, the more advanced users can provide their own or use more complicated likelihoods implemented in redback.
- Modify the physics of a transient model by passing in different class constructors
- Place constraints on priors if necessary.
