Fitting
============

After downloading/simulating data, creating a transient object, specifying a model,
and creating a prior we now come to the exciting part; Fitting the model to data!

To fit our model to data we have to specify a sampler and sampler settings.
The likelihood is set by default depending on the transient/data but one can use a different one
or write their own as explained in the likelihood `documentation <https://redback.readthedocs.io/en/latest/likelihood.html>`_

Installing :code:`redback` with minimal requirements will install the default sampler `dynesty
<https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Installing optional requirements will also install `nestle
<http://kylebarbary.com/nestle/`_. We generally find `dynesty` to be more reliable/robust but nestle is much faster.
We note that `dynesty` has checkpointing!

Samplers
---------------

As we use :code:`bilby` under the hood, we have access to several different samplers.
Cross-checking results with different samplers is often a great way to ensure results are robust
so we encourage users to install multiple samplers and fit models with different samplers.

Nested samplers

- Dynesty:
- Nestle
- CPNest
- PyMultiNest
- PyPolyChord
- UltraNest
- DNest4
- Nessai

MCMC samplers

- bilby-mcmc
- emcee
- ptemcee
- pymc3
- zeus

A full up to date list of samplers can be found in the `bilby documentation <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/samplers.html>`_.
This page also provides guidance on how to install these samplers, while the bilby `API <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/api/bilby.core.sampler.html>`_
provides information on the sampler settings for each sampler.

In redback, having created a transient object, specified a model, priors, fitting is done in a single line.

.. code:: python

    result = redback.fit_model(name='GRB', model=model, sampler='dynesty',
                               nlive=200, transient=afterglow, prior=priors,
                               data_mode='luminosity', **kwargs)

Here

- name: `GRB` is a string/name of transient fitting, this is used to .
- model: is a string referring to a function implemented in redback. Or a function the user has implemented.
- sampler: is a string referring to the sampler. It could be a string referring to any name of a sampler implemented in :code:`bilby`.
- nlive: is the number of live points to sample with. Higher = better. Typically we would use nlive=1000/2000 but this depends on the sampler.
- transient: the transient object
- prior: the prior object
- data_mode: type of data to fit.
- kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to fit_grb, such as the likelihood, or things required by the sampler, label of the result file, directory where results are saved to etc.
