============
Get data
============

:code:`redback` provides a simple interface to getting data from the open access, Swift, and BATSE catalogs, in different formats.
We also provide simple interfaces to get data from the FINK and LASAIR brokers, as well as the open access catalog. The different APIs to get data implemented in

- Swift: Prompt, X-ray afterglow [counts, flux, flux density]
- Open access catalog: Supernova, kilonova, tidal disruption event [photometry]
- FINK and LASAIR Broker: Supernova, kilonova, tidal disruption event or other transient [photometry]
- BATSE: Prompt [count rate]

For example, downloading the X-ray afterglow of GRB 070809 is as simple as

.. code:: python

    GRB = '070809'

    data = redback.get_data.get_bat_xrt_afterglow_data_from_swift(grb=GRB, data_mode="flux")

Or downloading the flux_density/magnitude data of the kilonova at2017gfo

.. code:: python

    kne = 'at2017gfo'

    data = redback.get_data.get_kilonova_data_from_open_transient_catalog_data(transient=kne)

Both these commands return the data, in a pandas dataframe. They also save the raw and processed data in a sensible way.
In particular, the kilonova data will be saved to :code:`kilonova/at2017gfo/` and the afterglow will be saved to :code:`afterglow/GRB070809/flux/`.

Please look at the API or the examples to see how we can get other data.

Basic processing and metadata
-------------------------

We do some basic processing to the raw data to make the files homogenous and save them in a homogenous format.
We also get metadata about the transient, such as redshift, start time, photon index etc from publically available sources.
Users can also provide this metadata themselves.

Private data or simulated data
-------------------------

We do not have to use data from the above catalogs for fitting. Redback can be used on private data or simulated data.
This is described in more detail in the transient or simulation documentation.

A general example which shows the API for downloading data from any of the above catalogs is available `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/more_v0.6stuff/examples/getting_data_with_redback.py>`_.
