Models
============

In :code:`redback` we have already implemented a lot of different models, which can be combined or modified to create another model easily.
These models range from phenomenological, to analytical, semi-analytical to numerical surrogates built with machine learning techniques.
Implementing a new model is probably the easiest way to contribute to redback!

Specifically, some of models already included are as follows.

Using :code:`redback` models as functions
-------------------------

All models in :code:`redback` are implemented as functions with minimal dependencies.
This means that users can simply use these functions by themselves as you would any other python function.
All users need to do is pass into the function a time array and any other parameter required by the function.
In this way, users can use :code:`redback` to just explore the impact of different parameters on the light curve and better understand the physics.

For example:

.. code:: python

    from redback.constants import day_to_s
    from redback.model_library import all_models_dict
    import numpy as np

    model = 'arnett_bolometric'

    function = all_models_dict[model]
    time = np.logspace(2, 8, 100)/day_to_s
    bolometric_luminosity = function(time, f_nickel=0.6,
                        mej=30, vej=1000, kappa=2, kappa_gamma=1e2)

Here we use `all_models_dict` to provide a simple way to access the relevant function. A user could of course just import the function themselves.

Users can also use the prior objects to get a simulation of the light curves predicted by the function for randomly drawn samples from the prior.

.. code:: python

    from redback.constants import day_to_s
    from redback.model_library import all_models_dict
    from redback.priors import get_priors
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    model = 'arnett_bolometric'
    priors = get_priors(model=model, data_mode='luminosity')
    samples = pd.DataFrame(priors.sample(100))
    function = all_models_dict[model]
    time = np.logspace(2, 8, 100)/day_to_s

    bolometric_luminosity = function(time, **samples.iloc[0])

Remember that the priors are simply a dictionary so users could also just pass a dictionary/dataframe they created themselves as well.

Users could also sample a lot of different draws from the prior at once (in the above we randomly drew a 100 samples) and then loop through them to simulate a population.
Remember that we can also place arbitrary constraints on the priors to make a really specific population/simulation.
For example, we could make a constraint that all priors in the population were brighter than 24th mag at peak or something else.
Almost any time of constraint is possible, as long as it can be written mathematically. Please look at prior documentation for more details on constraints.

Modifying :code:`redback` models
-------------------------

A lot of the physics in different :code:`redback` models is set by default.
However, several different pieces of physics in various models can be changed by either passing your own function/class (see `dependency injections <https://redback.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependency_injections.html>`_),
by switching the default argument with something else already implemented in redback, or changing a keyword argument.

The specific physics that can be changed:

- Jet spreading on/off
- Whether to infer lorentz factor in afterglow models
- Whether to turn on/off pair cascades
- Whether to turn on/off neutron precursor emission
- Different ejecta relations: See relations already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/ejecta_relations.py>`_.
- Different equations of states: See eos already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/eos.py>`_.
- Different interaction process: See processes already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/interaction_processes.py>`_.
- Different photosphere: See photospheres already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/photosphere.py>`_.
- Different SED: See SED's already implemented `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/redback/sed.py>`_.
- Gamma-ray leakage
- Engines with different energy injection rates

We encourage users to add more of these physics switches, which is another easy way to contribute to :code:`redback`.
