A key aspect of inference workflows is testing the pipeline on synthetic data.
This hugely beneficial in verifying both the inference methodology but for transients it is also useful in understanding selection effects, and the role of survey settings.
In :code:`redback`, we provide 3 different ways to simulate data as part of the simulation module.
Although, we emphasize that as all the models are callable functions, the user can bypass these to create their own synthetic data.

In particular the 3 methods are .
