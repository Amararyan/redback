============
Code motivation
============

The launch of new telescopes/surveys is leading to an explosion of transient observations.
Redback is a software package that enables end-to-end interpretation and parameter estimation of these transients.
Redback is built with an object oriented modular approach.
This ensures that users can use different parts of :code:`redback` for their own use without needing to interact with other parts.

How :code:`redback` can be useful to you
-------------------------

- Download data for supernovae, tidal disruption events, gamma-ray burst afterglows, kilonovae, prompt emission from
  different catalogs/telescopes; Swift, BATSE, Open access catalogs, ZTF, etc. Users can also provide their own data or use simulated data.
- Process transient data into a homogeneous transient object, providing an interface for plotting lightcurves and doing other processing.
- Fit one of the models implemented in :code:`redback`, or fit your own model.
  Models for several different types of electromagnetic transients are implemented and range from simple analytical models to numerical surrogates.
- All models are implemented as functions and can be used to simulate populations, without needing to provide data.
This way :code:`redback` can be used simply as a tool to simulate realistic populations, no need to actually fit anything.
- Fitting returns a homogenous result object, with functionality to plot lightcurves/walkers/corner and the posterior/evidence/credible interval etc.
This way :code:`redback` results can feed into hierarchical analysis of populations of transients or be used in reweighting.

Advantages of the interface to :code:`bilby`
-------------------------

We use `bilby <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/index.html>`_ under the hood for inference, which has many advantages.

- Easily change samplers, likelihoods, place constraints on priors, etc.
- Natural interface with gravitational-wave parameter estimation.
  Enabling multi-messenger analysis with :code:`redback` used in fitting to the electromagnetic data,
  and :code:`bilby` for gravitational-wave parameter estimation.
- A large developer/user base for core functionality.
  :code:`bilby` is adopted by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra Collaboration
  and used in all parameter estimation results by the LVK collaboration and in over 300 publications,
  a testament to its ease of use and robustness.
